# You and Us
Show of hands: programmers in the room ?

# What

## Application
* They are doing some job for us

## Programmable
* We can interact with them using programs, not UIs.

## Interfaces
* Black box with in/out definition.


## APIs vs Librairies
* Both are piece of reusable code
* The library runs on your server
* The API/service runs on the vendor/provider servers

Good for:
* The vendor that does'nt want to share its code
* You as you don't have to allocate the resource
* You as you don't have to store some datas

## Mostly about Web APIs
* Programmable Web
* M2M communications
* Typically REST

# Examples

* Maps: google map, open street maps
* Geocoding: Google Geocoding API
* Booking: AirBnb
* Twitter
* Stats: google analytics
* Project: Trello
* Chat: Slack
* Forms: wufoo
* SMS: twilio
* Mail: Mandrill
* Payment: Stripe

# Access types

* Anonymous
* Registred
* Paid

 # APIs vs Webhook
 * You call an API
 * The webhook is calling you

 Good to avoid "polling"

# Demo
## It all started with a website

## Then a form

## Leading to a Trello card

## Then to an SMS info

## Let's collect some leads
Get meetup members somewhere

# Zappier
* and IFTTT

# The Dark Side

## So, you just coupled your business to someone else whims
* Google Translate example
* Twitter example
* Surely a lot of others

## Don't run away ...
But be cautious, at least a bit.
